Javascript uses C syntax and supports object-oriented programming using prototypes instead of classes.

Javascript values are:
    - Number
        = There are no integers in javascript - just all numbers
        = There is a built-in "Math" object to be used like this: Math.sin(3.5)
        = parseInt will: parseInt('010', 10) = 10;
        = parseFloat does the same but always does base 10
        = isNaN("OBJECT HERE") to check if it is not a number
        = infinity and -infinity are values within JS
    - String
        = str.length will reveal the length of the string
        = str.charAt("NUMBER HERE")
        = str.replace('WORD TO REPLACE', 'REPLACE WITH THIS')
        = str.toUpperCase()
    - Boolean
        = Boolean('') = false;
        = Boolean(123) = true;
        = operators are &&, ||, !
    - Function
    - Object
        - Function
        - Array
        - RegExp
        - Date
    - Symbol
    - undefined
    - null

Variables in Javascript can be declared using let, var, const.
    - let
        = let is a block level variable
    - const
        = unchangeable within block level
    - var
        = var is only accessible when used within a function and further down
